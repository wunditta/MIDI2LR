Build.lua

Takes Database.lua and produces text lists and other tools for documentation
and updating. Has to be run under Lightroom to be properly translated,
but is not used by users of the plugin.

The tables below list all commands currently available in MIDI2LR for all submenus. The title row in each table corresponds with the title of the submenu in the app. Controls marked *button* are intended to be used with a button or key, and unmarked controls are for faders or encoders.

*Note*: <strong>â€»</strong> symbol indicates that the Adobe Lightroom API documentation does not include this command and an undocumented command may not always behave as expected. **Use with caution!**
